Relevant columns:

(1) log lookback time initial [yr]
(2) log lookback time final [yr]
(4) most likely SFR [Msun/yr]
(5) upper uncertainty on SFR (i.e., columns 4+5 = upper bound for plotting)
(6) lower uncertainty on SFR

(13) Most likely cumulative SFH
(14) upper uncertainty on cumulative SFH (i.e., columns 13 + 14 = upper bound for plotting)
(15) lower uncertainty on cumulative SFH

Columns (7) - (12) contains information about the metallicity solution, which I donâ€™t think it relevant for this work.
